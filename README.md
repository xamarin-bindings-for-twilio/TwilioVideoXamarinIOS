## How to Build

### Twilio.Video iOS 5.0.0 (February 11, 2022)
```
sh bootstrapper.sh
```

Add --registrar:static as additional mtouch arguments on iOS Build dialog for your iOS application.
Sometimes adding -cxx is also required.

## Sample

####  We don't have C# version of twilio quickstart application, so I highly recommend you to read about using native library bindings for xamarin and check official Twilio quickstart guides.
